The Paladins of Zthendol





The Paladin of Catastrophe and the Fortress of Eldryx
    The player comes across a small tent near an oasis in the desert. Inside this tent is a woman named Dianne Anasudra (codename Zerzuret).
    She's an archaeologist on the hunt for something her father once tried to find.
    It's an ancient desert fortress that houses a powerful gemstone thought to have been brought to this dimension during a great cataclysm.
    Unfortunately, that gemstone was taken and well guarded by a city that was toppled long ago.
    Rumor has it that the gemstone was left where it was first found, and for a reason that nobody knows.
    Its secrets were lost with the civilization that kept it, but somehow Dianne's father had some insight that few others had.
    After his old age and a life-threatening disease kept him from continuing his investigation, Dianne took up the chase herself, striving to find the treasure in hopes that it may wipe the disease from her father.
    When the player comes across her, she is desperate for help, as she seems to have not found anyone in her entire months-long journey who can give her aid.
    And the player seems like the perfect help!

    Fortunately for the player, Dianne knows the relative location of the fortress, and tells the player its exact distance from the point they stand.
    The player's job is to seek out the fortress and attempt to get in somehow. It won't be easy, and traps will impede the player's progress as much as they can.
    When the player manages to get into a central chamber, Dianne will reach the player and come inside as well. She'll inform the player that her father's efforts could only ever barely scratch the surface of what was inside, but that the player must still try to find clues as to what to do next. There will be something rather obvious to do, but the things required to move on will have to be somewhat challenging.

    Eventually, after these trials are completed, the player and Dianne will gain access to the final chamber, where an ancient mummy will act as a "final" challenge to Dianne and the player. The mummy will constantly whisper to the player and to Dianne about the dangers presented in the power of the gemstone, but Dianne will be headstrong in her resolve to get the stone and save her father. The mummy will speak about how the gemstone is actually capable of its own thoughts and emotions, and will be even stronger than the mummy itself. It won't fight with blades or bows, but with the mind. It has the power to take over a host body, infuse it with chaotic energy, and command it as its pawn. This is exactly what happens after the player and Dianne beat the mummy. Dianne, not thinking for a moment, tries to grab the gemstone to take it with her, but is immediately taken over by a strong magical force--the gemstone. Dianne turns to the player and, in a completely different voice, booms out that the player is just as much of a threat to the gemstone as Dianne was, and thus must be eliminated. This is where the true final fight of this questline takes place.

    The gemstone will sense the player's powers over the course of the fight, and will come to an understanding that the player isn't just any old threat--they're the very force the gemstone was designed to help overcome. Eldryx, an ancient entity bent on destruction and ruin, is the one who created the gemstone and the fortress. The ancient civilization that found the gemstone was actually a cult of followers of Eldryx, who frequently sacrificed their own people to the gemstone to help grow Eldryx's power. Eventually, the city that these cultists lived in fell to another power, and thus Eldryx was put into a deep slumber without regular sacrifices. Dianne woke this entity up, and now is under the control of Eldryx. Fortunately, since this is the only soul Eldryx has access to, his strength is heavily stunted. This gives the player ample opportunity to destroy this evil force once and for all.

Satchel Enchantment: Each tool can carry an amount of specific items that it is efficient for
Redstone Engine enchantment: Use redstone (or another item idk) to power up your tool, granting haste while held

Randomized stat changes for Companions (data modify stuff)
Companions can be converted into Life Essence so duplicates don't become an issue (use this essence to create other companions)

The Halundfell Dimension - Where Magic Once Flowed
 - Contains a questline that allows players to renew the magic in the world (per player, only those who have completed the questline can use spells in the dimension)
 - Contains a boss that must be summoned using magic, and a boss that acts as the final climax for the quest

[previously Harpsong Sycophant]
Sunsong Sycophant should be next boss, maybe consider a drop that allows for Multicasting (but only for like 2 or 3 spells at a time) "Thousandth Strand?"

Change reduced Cooldown Time on each upgraded Runic Tablet to apply its cooldown change to when RunicSpellStart tag is on players, will make it so that it won't update until after the spell's altered cooldown time is applied

Necrosculker Boss Fight:
    Rather than being a beat-down on a damage sponge, it could be a survival challenge where the boss tries to weaken your mind so that it can use the Takeover spell on you and make you into one of its minions. It uses some bullet-hell aspects of showing an area of attack, and then attacking there, mixed with some aspects of a normal boss like summoning its own minions to fight you and try to push you toward where the boss will hit. Can use boss bars to show time remaining until the boss is out of steam and for the amount of mental fortitude you have remaining before Takeover works on you.
    The Takeover, Tendril Wave, and Blind Spells should be some of the rewards for successfully surviving and beating this boss!

Solidify (?) Spell - Turn Lava / Water to Obsidian / Stone depending on what item is in offhand
Liquidate (?) Spell - Turn Ice / Stone or Obsidian to Water / Lava depending on what item is in offhand


Jukebox automation - dropper drops stick, disc is ejected
Necrosculker fixes - more obvious indicators of lasers, changing directions, slower/faster - done
                     fix where players can jump up on pillars to avoid the lasers or the tendrils when enraged (maybe another laser higher up, or teleporting the player downward) - done
                     Fix for the Sculk Catalyst triggering with the Tendrils
                     Make Totem of Undying give resistance so lasers don't hit through them - done


Siphon Enchant - Take an enchantment off of an item in the user's offhand (not a book) and apply it to a single book in a glow item frame nearby (unless the book already has an enchantment)

Finish Chain Mine Spell


Add more Soul Foci to Soul Steal Spell

Implement more Advancements

Time Flux Spell (grows more powerful the longer you wait between casts)

Armor Trim / Material Abilities (?)




Other people's ideas/contributions:
Incubation Chamber to work with companions? Make new ones, boost existing ones, evolve, upgradeable table
Custom Biome (maybe implemented and generated using a Spell?)





|=============VVVVVVV===============|
|>>>>>>>>>>>> Balance <<<<<<<<<<<<<<|
|=============^^^^^^^===============|





To Do:

All current planned spells



Maybe:
Spell Rewards:
Track stats and other things to give access to spells upon reaching a milestone. For instance, jumping 20 times gives Leap (maybe not exactly like this, but that's just the idea)

BOSSES!
1-8 = Common Bosses, varying degree of integrity to the world's story
9-12 = Domain's Devout, first really deep segment of bosses with intricate lore, can or should be able to be fought in any order (unless fighting Post-Sin versions)
13+ = Superbosses, designed to be both integral to the world's story and a highly difficult challenge. Each and every boss is stronger than the last, but not always necessary to beat (unless fighting Post-Sin versions)
